## 🔐 Introduction to Cryptography and Solana Clients
In this section, we explored:
- The basics of cryptography as it applies to the Solana blockchain.
- How to interact with the Solana blockchain via clients and wallets.
- Key concepts like private/public key pairs, signatures, and encryption algorithms used in blockchain technologies.

---

## 💰 Tokens and NFTs on Solana
This section covers:
- How to create fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana blockchain.
- Using the `@solana/spl-token` library for token creation and management.
- Token minting and interacting with Solana smart contracts for NFTs.

---

## 💻 Onchain Program Development
Topics explored include:
- Developing onchain programs (smart contracts) using Solana's Anchor framework.
- Creating, deploying, and interacting with onchain programs that perform complex operations on the blockchain.
- Handling Solana accounts, data serialization, and deserialization.

---

## 🔧 Token Extensions
In this section:
- We focused on creating tokens with extended features, such as non-transferable tokens, tokens with mint authority, and other advanced features.
- Understanding SPL Token extensions and their practical use cases in Solana decentralized applications.

---

## ⚡ Program Optimization
This section delves into:
- Techniques for optimizing Solana programs to reduce transaction costs and improve performance.
- Efficient design patterns to maximize the use of Solana’s transaction execution model.
- Best practices for minimizing compute usage and improving storage efficiency.

---

## 📦 State Compression
Here we explored:
- Implementing state compression for handling large amounts of onchain data, particularly for large-scale NFT collections.
- Techniques to reduce the amount of state data stored on-chain, thereby lowering costs for developers and users.
- Examples of compressing NFT collections and managing compressed states within Solana programs.
